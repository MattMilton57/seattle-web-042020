# Find Greatest Product of Two Adjacent Elements

Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.

## Examples

```javascript
adjacentProducts([3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3])
  => 21
adjacentProducts([1,1,1,19,1,1,1])
  => 19
```
For inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3], the output should be adjacentElementsProduct(inputArray) = 21.

7 and 3 produce the largest product.

## Constraints

- 2 ≤ inputArray.length ≤ 10, -1000 ≤ inputArray[i] ≤ 1000.
- The array will contain only integers, and containin at least two elements.
